# Description

When I heard the term interactive poster I thought of a 70's-esk optical illusions that you could "interact" with and possibly even "fall" into. I am not sure how well I executed my vision but this is the idea I decided to run with. 

Introducting Interactive Illusion. An optical illusion application that allows you to interact with it to create cool and unique optical illusions. Future features will include more complex user interactions and the ability to save a video of the illusion to your device.
